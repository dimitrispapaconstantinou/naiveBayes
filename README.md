# naiveBayes
naive Bayes algorithm implementation for spam detection

A very simple implementation of naive Bayes, based on the corpora given by
http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/PU123ACorpora.tar.gz

Each step of the 10-fold Cross Validation is hard coded so it can be more obvious how exactly works.

Results to compaire  can be found in the following paper: http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/docs/TR2004_updated.pdf

Plase make sure to change the paths of the datasets in source code berore running the app.
